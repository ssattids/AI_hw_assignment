Running question five:
python p5.py

The program will display (except in Edlab, the graphs were not shown but they were saved as png files) and save the graph in the current directory that is asked in question 5. Everytime this command is run, the graphs will change, since the goals are randomly generated.

Running question six:
python p6.py

The program will display all the randomly generated cities with their edges, then, it will show the MST and finally the graph of the TSP asked in question 6. Everytime this command is run, the graphs will change, since the cities are randomly generated.
